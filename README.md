yess, just that easy. One line of code and youâ€™re in.

I Built a Tic-Tac-Toe App ðŸŽ®
Just to test the vibe, I asked Gemini to help me build a Tic-Tac-Toe app in JavaScript.

Here's what I did:

Installed Gemini CLI
- Ran gemini in my terminal
- Wrote the prompt for Tic-Tac-Toe
- It instantly started generating the code â€” BOOMMM ðŸ’¥
- I ran itâ€¦ and there was the magic âœ¨
