# CLI-Node.js

Create a `command line interface` that lets the user specify a file path and the nodejs process counts the number of words inside it.

```jsx
Input - node index.js /Users/kirat/file.txt
Output - You have 10 words in this file
```

AND ALSO 
Approach 2: We will create only a single function to greet the user. Within the greet() function there will be three sections. First, we will display the "Geeks CLI" welcome message on the terminal. For this, we will be using the figlet package which is a program that generates texts based on ASCII characters. Secondly, we will prompt the user to enter his/her name in the terminal using the inquirer package and store it in a variable. Lastly, we will greet the user with his/her name and also color the message using the gradients-string package.
